# Track Slider

## Description
The main idea here is to have two channel brackets running side by side.  A display board will be hanging from each and they will move back in forth, opposite to each other.  From these will be hanging display boards with cool halloween images.  

## Hardware inventory
- 2 @ 48" 1 5/8" strut channel
- 2 @ 1 5/8" strut channel trolley
- 4 @ 1 5/8" strut channel hanger - needed as mounts from the inside of the strus will impede the trolley progress
- 1 @ 40" linear actuator - 6 mm/sec - super slow (3 minutes for full extension/restration) but also whisper quiet
- 1 battery operated mini strobe - anchored to back of motor controlled trolley
- 6 @ eye screws - for anchoring nylon cord
- nylon cord - to enable the motorized board to pull the other one so that they both move.
- red film - holes will be drilled for images eyes and the film is attached to the back of the hanging board.  When the strobe flashes, it will shine (red) through.

## Control
Will only need to control a single actuator and this can piggy back off of the ghost closet.  The linear actuator used here is a heavy amp draw, so will need to use that controller anyway. 
The main control loop simply moves the trolley back and forth.  As the movement time for this is so slow, this will just run on a continuous loop during peak time for visitors.
