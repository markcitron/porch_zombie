# Haunted Porch
### Control Box
Single control for overall porch. Will allow for switch control to turn things on/off or to reset.  This will reduce the need to have a laptop/desktop available to fire things up, etc.  The porch control scripts should be service level control so that they are alwasy on/off, depending on the service control.
