#Mr Creepy
This is the porch scarecrow.  He sits there and reactis when people come on to the porch.  He has human like moving joints and a pretty cool right hand - driven by 5 servos.  The wrist and forearm are servos so there is pretty good motion.  The arms and shoulders are linear actuators so great motion, though less granular control.  If I have the time this go around, I will add a stepper controlled twisting waist (inside of a lazy susan style joint).  

I haven't figured out what to do with the next yet.  Last year, it was just a pinear actuaor controlled nexk so that the head could angle down to rest the chin on the chest.  I would like it to be a bit cooler this year.

The head ... still thinking here too.  Last year, I had a creepy Jack 'O Lantern head that had motor controlled face motions as well as some text.  I triggered it with one of the relay control units.  So far, I have two LED ring "eyes" and a webcam for the "nose".  As it also has a microphone, we can maybe use voice controls - I have 7 months as of writing this so I will be optimistic here :-)
