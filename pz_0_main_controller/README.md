# Haunted Porch
This is the controller for the porch setup. 

## Triggers
- IR Sensor - simple sensor to fire when someone is walking along the path up to the porch, just past the garage door
- OpenCV - going to get a little fancier and see if we can have OpenCV detect different people coming up and not flag for certain folks. For this, I'll start with stuff that I have done in the past but heavily used Copilot to help generate code and a trainable model.
