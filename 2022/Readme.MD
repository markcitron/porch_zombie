# Porch Zombie 2022
Halloween is coming :-)
## Theme
Taking a slight focus twist this year.  Will be mixing homegrown with triggers to store bought to make things fuller.  Anything store bought will be triggered using a controlled relay and wither timed or triggered from the controller unit.
## Spirit Helpers
- Controller - RPi with camera to do motion detection and control of the other spirit helpers. In addition or possibly instead of the usual motion library and/or openCv, I might try using a LIDAR unit to track people moving on the porch and adjust the activity that way. 
- Flexing wooden wall: using the linear actuators to make wall look like it is breathing. Something like the flexing walls in the Haunted Mansion at Disneyland.  It is one of the three best rides there so copying is far game. Can control with a single actualtor and have it look like a ghoul/zombie is trying to come through the break in thge door.
- Ghoul/zombie/skeleton to swing out over the left side fo the porch via a single actuator swinging in a horizontal arc
- Moving ghoul/zombie/skeleton along a garage door track.  Spirit on a hanging piece of painted plywood with a strobe angling downward on the travelling arm.
- Maybe a throwback bench zombie with a disapproving head shake?
- Maybe a wandering spider?
